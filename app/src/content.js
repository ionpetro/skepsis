// Course content for "Skepsis".
//
// Three kinds of items:
//   root    - a Greek word part. `ex` = example words: [word, plain definition, tiles[]].
//             The first two examples are taught on the intro card; the rest are held back
//             so the learner can try to decode a word they have not seen (transfer).
//   idea    - a Greek concept, myth or business word. Has a story, a Texas angle, a
//             "use it at work" line and one scenario question.
//   origin  - a word for the "Is it Greek?" game: greek true/false plus where it comes from.
//
// Every item also has `say`: a one-breath line someone can use to teach it to a colleague.
// Facts were checked against Merriam-Webster / Etymonline; see ../RESEARCH.md for notes.
